## Project Overview

A comprehensive dataset merging DAWN (Detection in Adverse Weather Nature) and WEDGE (WEather images by DALL-E GEneration) datasets for enhanced autonomous vehicle vision in adverse weather conditions.


# Dataset Characteristics
DAWN Dataset


1000 real-traffic images
7,846 total objects
4 weather conditions: fog, snow, rain, sandstorms
Resolution: 1280x675 pixels
Class distribution heavily skewed towards cars (82.3%)


#WEDGE Dataset
3,360 synthetic images
16,513 annotated objects
16 weather conditions
Resolution: 640x640 pixels
More balanced class distribution (cars 40.4%, persons 36.5%)


# Key Features
Combined total of 24,359 annotated objects
Comprehensive weather condition coverage
Complementary real and synthetic data
Standardized XML annotation format
Diverse object size and position distributions


# Data Distribution
Object classes: cars, trucks, persons, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, vans
Weather conditions: fog, snow, rain, sand, hurricane, lightning, night, spring, summer, sun, tornado, windy, winter
Multiple object scales and aspect ratios
Varied environmental conditions


# Usage
Autonomous vehicle vision system training
Object detection in adverse weather
Domain adaptation research
Synthetic-to-real transfer learning


# Benefits
Enhanced model robustness
Reduced data collection risks
Cost-effective dataset expansion
Improved rare condition coverage
Better class balance for training
